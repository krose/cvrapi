This is a quick and dirty introduction to the CVR API.


```{r}

library(cvrapi)

```


This is how you use the search function. The result is a list with a nested data.frame in 'productionunits'.


```{r}

cvr_get(search = "RK Foto ApS", country = "dk")

```

You can also search directly in the names of companies.


```{r}

cvr_get(search = "RK Foto ApS", country = "dk", search_in = "name")

```
